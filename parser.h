* CS 374 - Operating Systems I
* Program description: This program creates a shell called smallsh. smallsh implements a subset
*                      if well-known shells, such as bash. The program does the following:
*

*                      - Executes 3 commands exit, cd, and status via code built into the shell
*                      - Executes other commands by creating new processes using a function from 
*                        the exec() family of functions
*                      - Supports input and output redirection
